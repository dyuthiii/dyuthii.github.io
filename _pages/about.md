Hello! My name is Dyuthi, and I'm an enthusiastic researcher with a passion for psychology. I graduated with an honors degree in B.Sc Psychology from the University of British Columbia. Throughout my academic journey, I actively participated in numerous research projects, taking on the role of the primary research assistant for two of them. These experiences have honed my skills in research design, implementation and data analytics. My specific interests lie in the fields of social psychology, neuroscience, behavior, cognition, and social media. You can find more details about my professional background in my CV.

  When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy gaming, crocheting, reading, rocking out to music, and playing the drums are some of the activities that bring me joy and relaxation. Another significant part of my life is my love for animals. Growing up, I had the pleasure of caring for four guinea pigs, and currently, I am lucky to have the most amazing companion named Milo. 
In my free time, I actively contribute to wildlife rehabilitation as a volunteer, fueling my passion for animal welfare. I have also been independently rescuing stray animals around Bangalore, India. 

Feel free to explore my website further to learn more about my work and interests.
