Hello! My name is Dyuthi, and I'm an enthusiastic researcher with a passion for psychology. I graduated with an honors degree in B.Sc Psychology from the University of British Columbia. Throughout my academic journey, I actively participated in numerous research projects, taking on the role of the primary research assistant for two of them. These experiences have honed my skills in research design, implementation and data analytics. My specific interests lie in the fields of social psychology, neuroscience, behavior, cognition, mental health social media, and gaming. You can find more details about my professional background on this website, and in my CV.

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy gaming, crocheting, and reading. Another significant part of my life is my love for animals. Growing up, I had the pleasure of caring for four guinea pigs, and currently, I am lucky to have the most amazing boy named Milo. 
In my free time, I volunteer for wildlife rehabilitation and have been independently rescuing stray animals around Bangalore, India. 

Feel free to explore my website further to learn more about my work and interests.

## The Goodest Boy, Milo
